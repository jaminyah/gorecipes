# Bubble Sort Algorithm

### Performance
Big-O (n^2)

1. set a boolean variable to track if a swap has occurred.
2. while swap is true, loop through all the elements.
3. if the next element is smaller than the previous, perform a swap.
4. set swap variable to true
5. perform the while loop until swap is false.
6. elements are now sorted.
